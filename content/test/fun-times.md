I never thouight I would write a quick note about a pandemic in my lifetime. I knew it was coming, it was just a matter time for the planet, but I did not expect it in my lifetime.
Please get your health information from reliable sources, such as the the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov) or the [National Institues of Health](https://www.nih.gov).
Johns Hopkins University is a great [resource](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu) of information. I like the [map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) best.

Here is a puppy to cheer you up.

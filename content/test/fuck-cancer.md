A friend of mine died from cancer yesterday. I am sad and mad. My friend is survived by her son and her Aunt/Mom. Her ex-husband committed suicide a week earlier, so now her son has neither a mom or a dad. He is only 15, or 16, I forget. I am mad because she knew she had a lump in her breast but waited years to see a Dr. It had spread to her brain, spinal column and other parts of her body by the time she saw a Dr. I donâ€™t understand how anyone can wait that long to get treatment. Breast cancer has a high survival rate, but only if you see a Dr in time. If anyone reading this finds a lump in their breast please see a Dr ASAP.
